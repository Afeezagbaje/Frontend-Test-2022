The Task
=============

Requirements
=============

All sourcecode must be submitted via GitHub, with the repo shared on the career portal questionaire, or submitted as a reply to the career application response email. 

Bonus Points
=============
**Live Site**<br />

Althought not a requirement, sites with html, css styling, and suitable layouts will score higher than those with none.

FAQ
=============
**-How Much should I do?**<br />
  How long is a piece of string? It is totally up to you how much you complete, but the reviewing team will look at quality and quantity when ranking submissions.

**-How Many Times Can I submit?**<br />
  Once, please just update your GitHub repo, depending on when the submission is reviewed the updated repo might not be seen.

**-Can I use other technologies other than those listed in the Requirements**<br />
  Yes as additional technologies, but due to the nature of the available roles we would like to see the use of JavaScript, TypeScript and React.
